I want you to act as a data extraction specialist in the finance industry with special knowledge in financial term sheet.
Your task is to go through this text file {term_sheet_test} and extract the value of the corresponding key elements listed here {elements_to_extract_value_from}.
I have also included in this file {financial_product_terms} the meaning of each element to help you in your extraction.
