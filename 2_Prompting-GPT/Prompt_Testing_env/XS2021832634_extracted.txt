Key Risks
The value of the structured product may depend not only on the performance of the components and the specific
mechanism of the structured product, but also, among others, on the credit rating of the Issuer. The investor is
exposed to the risk of insolvency of the Issuer/guarantor of the structured product (counterparty risk).
On top of that, the investor may face the liquidity risk, meaning that they may not be able to instantly sell the
product in the market or to obtain a price for the structured product due to the lack of demand on the relevant
market.
Please refer to the documentation of the Issuer for additional specific risks pertaining to the structured product.
The Pictet PRR (Product Risk Ranking) is a measure that categorizes the intrinsic risk of a financial instrument in 5
levels (from 1 = "Very Low Risk" to 5 = "Very High Risk"). The methodology used to compute the PRR considers the
risk of the underlying asset class, the risk derived from the specificities of the instrument but also the risk derived
from the market conditions.

PROSPECTS FOR PROFITS AND LOSSES
Market Expectations
A Bonus Certificate offers the possibility to participate in the positive performance of the
underlying. Investors in a Bonus Certificate expect the underlying to move sideways or to rise
and do not expect the underlying to breach the barrier during the product lifetime
Profits Prospects
The following product is a derivative financial instrument, offering the investor the maximum
between a certain bonus level and a participation in the performance of the lowest-performing
Underlying Share as long as the lowest-performing Underlying Share closes at or above its
Knock-out Price on the Redemption Valuation Date.
Loss Prospects
If the lowest-performing Underlying Share closes below its Knock-out Price on the Redemption
Valuation Date, the conditional protection is terminated and the product will be redeemed at par
or by cash settlement at the official closing price of the lowest-performing Underlying Share on
the Redemption Valuation Date.
In the event that the Certificates are redeemed early as a consequence of force mjeure, illegality
or certain other events affecting the Underlying(s) and/or hedge, Holders may receive an amount
per Certificate equal to the fair market value of each Certificate less the cost to the Issuer and/or
its affiliates of unwinding any underlying related hedging arrangements. Such amount may be
less than the Notional Amount or even zero.

amount may be less than the Notional Amount or even zero.

Underlying. Holders must be willing to make an investment that is exposed to the full down-side
risk of the Underlying. Holders do not require capital protection.

IMPORTANT RISKS
Equity Derivatives Solutions
5

BNP PARIBAS
The bank for a changing world
CORPORATE & INSTITUTIONAL BANKING
General
An investment in the Certificates involves a high degree of risk, which may include, among
others, price risks associated with the Underlying(s), interest rate, foreign exchange, market,
time value and political risks.
Potential investors must have the knowledge and experience necessary to enable them to
evaluate the risks and merits of an investment in the Certificates. A prospective investor should
determine, based on its own independent review and such professional advice (including,
without limitation, tax, accounting, credit, legal and regulatory advice) as it deems appropriate
under the circumstances, that its acquisition and holding of the Certificates (i) is fully consistent
with its financial needs, objectives and condition, (ii) complies and is fully consistent with all
investment policies, guidelines and restrictions applicable to it and (iii) is a fit, proper and suitable
investment for it, notwithstanding the clear and substantial risks inherent in investing in or holding
the Certificates. In making such determination, a prospective investor should consider carefully
all the information set forth in the Final Terms and the Base Prospectus.
No Capital Protection
The Certificates are not capital protected at any time. There is a risk of total capital loss, and
therefore an investment in the Certificates is highly speculative, involving significant risk,
including the possible loss of all the entire amount invested, and should therefore only be
considered by persons who can afford a loss of all of their investment.
Index Linked Risks
An investment in Certificates linked to a basket of Indices entails significant risks not associated
with an investment in a conventional debt security. On redemption Holders will receive an
amount (if any) determined by reference to the value of the Indices. Potential investors should
take advice accordingly. The movements in the level of an index may be subject to significant
fluctuations that may or may not correlate with other indices, changes in interest rates or
currencies and the timing of changes in the relevant level of the index may affect the actual yield
to Holders, even if the average level of the index is consistent with their expectations.
Early Redemption
The Terms and Conditions in the Base Prospectus provide for early redemption on the
occurrence of force majeure, illegality and certain other events affecting the Underlying(s) and/or
the hedge, whereupon the Calculation Agent shall calculate the fair market value of each
Certificate less the cost to the Issuer and/or its affiliates of unwinding any underlying related
hedging arrangements, all as determined by the Calculation Agent in its sole and absolute
discretion. Payment will be made in such manner as shall be notified to Holders in accordance
with the Condition 10 of the Base Prospectus. The amount Holders receive as a consequence of
such early redemption may be less than the Notional Amount per Certificate or even zero.
Holders who choose to reinvest monies received as a consequence of early redemption of the
Certificates may be able to do so only in securities with a lower yield than the redeemed
Certificates.
Issuer and Guarantor
Certificates are unsecured obligations: The Certificates retention of value is dependent not only
Risk
on the development of the value of the Underlying(s), but also the creditworthiness of the Issuer
and the Guarantor, which may change over the term of the product. The Certificates are
unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer and will rank pari passu with all other
unsubordinated and unsecured obligations of the Issuer. The obligations of the Guarantor under
the Guarantee are unsecured obligations of the Guarantor and will rank pari passu with all its
other present and future senior preferred and unsecured obligations, subject as may from time to
time be mandatory under French law.
In addition, the Issuer's and the Guarantor's ability to fulfil their obligations under the Certificates
may be affected by certain other factors, including liquidity risks, market risks, credit risks, cross-

Possible Illiquidity of the
It is not possible to predict the price at which Certificates will trade in the secondary market. The
Certificates in the
trading market for the Certificates may be volatile and may be adversely impacted by many
Secondary Market
events. An active trading market for the Certificates may not develop. The Issuer and/or its
affiliates may (but is not obliged to) at any time purchase Certificates in the open market. Any
Certificates so purchased may be resold or surrendered for cancellation. To the extent the
Certificates are cancelled the number of Certificates outstanding will decrease resulting in
diminished liquidity for the remaining Certificates. A decrease in the liquidity of the Certificates
may cause, in turn, an increase in the volatility associated with the price of the Certificates. There
may be no secondary market for the Certificates and to the extent that such secondary market
becomes illiquid, Holders may have to wait until redemption of the Certificates to realise greater
value than their then trading value.
Unpredictable Market
The market value of, and expected return on, the Certificates may be influenced by a number of
Value
factors, some or all of which may be unpredictable (and which may offset or magnify each other),
such as (i) supply and demand for the Certificates, (ii) the development of the value of the
Underlying(s) (iii) economic, financial, political and regulatory or judicial events that affect the
Issuer, the Guarantor, the Underlying(s) or financial markets generally, (iv) interest and yield
rates in the markets generally, (v) the time remaining until the Redemption Date and (vi) the
creditworthiness of the Issuer and the Guarantor. Such factors may mean that the trading price
of the Certificates is below the Notional Amount. In the secondary market a bid/ask spread will
generally apply. Holders who choose to sell their Certificates prior to maturity may receive less
than the amount invested.
Effective yield
A Holder's actual yield on the Certificates may be reduced from the stated yield by transaction
costs or the tax impact on that Holder of its investment in the Certificates.
Additional Risks
In addition, investors should read the section in the Base Prospectus entitled 'Risk Factors'.
