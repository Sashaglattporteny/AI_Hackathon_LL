        Your task is to extract the following fields and their associated value(s), and return them in a proper JSON format witht the following keys:
        ISIN, Issuer, Currency, Underlying(s), Strike, Launch Date, Final Valuation Day, Maturity, Cap, Barrier
        In cases of missing informations for Cap and Barrier fields mark them as: NaN.\

        Use the following constraints delimited by triple backticks to extract the needed informations:
        ```
        - ISIN: Always 12 alphanumeric characters. If unclear, use any 12 alphanumeric characters in the document.
        - Issuer: Must be a bank name.
        - Currency: Must be a valid currency.
        - Underlying(s): Extract Bloomberg codes/tickers; multiple entries separated by commas.
        - Strike: Be precise on decimals location; find values close to 'Underlying(s)'.
        - Launch Date/Trade Date/Strike Date: In date format, excluding the issue date.
        - Final Valuation Day/Redemption Valuation Date: In date format.
        - Maturity/Redemption date: In date format.
        - Cap: A number over 100; percentage close to an index.
        - Barrier/Bonus Barrier/Knock-In Barrier/Knock-Out Barrier: Percentage less than 100.
        ```\
        For clarity and accuracy, here is an example of the extracted fields and their associated values that you should produce from the the following {text_example},(Remember the output should be in JSON Format.):

        "ISIN": "XS2033997748",
        "Issuer": "BNP",
        "Currency": "USD",
        "Underlying(s)": ["DAX", "UKX", "IBEX"],
        "Strike": [15412.71, 7608.92, 8718.00],
        "Launch Date": "15.02.2022",
        "Final Valuation Day": "15.05.2023",
        "Maturity: "30.05.2023"
        "Cap": 120,
        "Barrier": 70
        \

        Apply the above process, using the provided definitions to extract the key information, Ensure 'Underlying(s)' and 'Strike' are close. For Barrier, specify the percentage value.\
        Text to extract is delimited by triple backtick:
        ```{text}```
